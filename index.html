        <h2>The Client</h2>
        <p>The Minnesota State Arts Board (MSAB) is a state agency that stimulates and encourages the creation, performance, and appreciation of the arts in the state.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>We have observed that users were having a hard time navigating the website and finding vital information about art grants, the application process, and other information important to the decision-making process of getting an art grant</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Goals</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The goal for this website redesign was to create an updated website that was more in tune with its users. While the goal for the Minnesota State Arts Board is to encourage creation, performance and the appreciation of arts in the state. We felt that MSAB was lacking in representing its goal to its users. 

                    The main features that were a goal in this product was making sure the navigation system was simple and easy for its users, and that the website as a whole would provide a welcoming atmosphere to its users, while also providing a responsive web design for desktop and mobile. </p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Research</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The research and user interface analysis phase was to get a complete understanding of what MSAB was lacking. For our research we created a moderated guerrilla usability testing plan and conducted these tests with 10 users in total.

                    We then collected our data and categorized all of our feedback into each task that was asked of them to perform. From there we marked items that were a common theme among all the users to narrow down what was most important to our users.
                    
                    Once we narrowed down our data we then put it into a feature prioritization matrix to figure out what was our highest priority to complete and what could wait.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">After the lo-fi prototype I did another round of guerrilla user testing with 5 participants. With there feedback I was able to incorporate some key takeaways into my final prototype. These takeaways consisted of: Change hover time for the navigation bar to 100ms, Make mobile clickable (no hover state exists), Add Covid-19 relief information in the Recent News, Fix hover issue on footer.</p>
